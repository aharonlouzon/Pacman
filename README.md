PACMAN

This program simulates a Pacman game board. The main method: fingGhosts() will find the shortest distance from Pacman to every ghost that is reachable to it. The second file, PriorityQueue.py is a priority queue class, designed by me, wich is used in fingGhosts().

In class main() please find two examples thas show how to use the methods. Simply run Main.py in-order to see the output of the examples and then feel free to make changes and tests.

The code is written in Python3.
